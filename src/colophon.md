# Colophon

This site is a small static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The pages are written in either markdown or nunjucks. I write all of my content in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), and develop this website with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This website's code is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/MattMcAdams/mattmcadams.com) and hosted by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Images are optimized with [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) and hosted on [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) for all images.

My domains are all registered through [Hover](https://www.hover.com/), but I generally use Cloudflare's DNS. For analytics, I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## Other tools

These weren't strictly used for the creation of this website, but I do use these quite a lot and they remain important to my work.

- [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)
- [Bear](https://bear.app/)
- [Procreate](https://procreate.com/)
- [Prospect](https://jaromvogel.com/prospectapp)
- [Numi](https://numi.app/)
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)

On a more personal note, I've also written up a list of my personal affects in the form of a [what's in my bag](/objects) style post.
